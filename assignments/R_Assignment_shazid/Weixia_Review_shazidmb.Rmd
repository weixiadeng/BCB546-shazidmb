Data inspection and visulaization looks perfect. And frankly speaking, some for your code inspires me and helps me to imporve my work.

But one thing I am not sure is for the missing data in output files, should we still use `-/-` and `?/?` or just a single `-` and `?` (as you did). The homework description is not very clear.
